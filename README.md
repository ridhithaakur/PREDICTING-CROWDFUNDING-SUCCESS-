# PREDICTING-CROWDFUNDING-SUCCESS-


 creating a tool that trains a decision tree machine learning model to 
perform the task of classifying crowdfunding posts. The dataset of crowdfunding posts is taken 
from Kiva.com, which allows users to loan small amounts of money to small business ventures 
in developing countries. Some posts meet their funding goals and receive the loans, whereas 
others expire before doing so. The goal of this tool is to predict the success or failure of these 
posts as accurately as possible. 
 
The dataset contains data on 6,300 posts. The decision tree model will make predictions based 
on five factors: 
• Length: the number of characters in the post. 
• Number of pictures: the number pictures in the post. 
• Loan amount: the amount of money requested by the post. 
• Bonus credit eligibility: whether the post was eligible for any bonus or promotional 
opportunity on Kiva.com (yes/no). 
• User favorite post: whether the post received many page views on Kiva.com (yes/no). 
 
the decision tree model will predict the loan status (funded/expired).
